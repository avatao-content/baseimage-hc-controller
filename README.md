#### Headless Chrome controller

This is the future since development of PhantomJS is discontinued.

Notes
 - The solution check should work as `user` as well
 - `check.js` is not complete in this baseimage
 - Make sure you run the `node check.js` command from `/opt`
 - First run could be slow ( >10 seconds )
 - No `ubuntu-14.04` branch
